<p>One bead at a time. That is how these pieces of art are created. They began as simple peyote stitch pieces that have evolved into multi media works that are whimsical, touching, distressing, thought provoking, and heart warming. They involve numerous hours to complete and leverage my quilting background and love of fabric as a form of expression. Blending of the bead with fabric and found objects presents a formidable challenge and requires understanding the elements and principles of design. The result is a piece of work that displays the merging of technical and aesthetic elements into a cohesive art form.</p>
