<p>As an art instructor for over twenty years, I taught a variety media to my students, and as such enjoy working in acrylic, watercolor, inks with threads, fabric, beading, found objects, clay, art quilts, fabric painting, monotypes, 3D miniatures, printmaking, metal and glass.  I often combine media together, and continue to explore new ways of working.</p>
