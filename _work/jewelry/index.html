<p>Beads have a history, a calming effect and sometimes a story to tell. The arrangement of beads in a necklace or bracelet again draw on design elements and color combinations I learned over the years as an art student and teacher. Adornment to me is simplistic, colorful and sometimes regal. There is a pattern to my work, but not a dependency on symmetry. I enjoy using mixed beads, mixed textures, some metal, and beaded buttons as findings and clasps.</p>
