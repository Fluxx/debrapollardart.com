Animals, especially gorillas, horses, and cows have been a fascination for me from an early age. Recently I started also painting chickens and orangoutangs, the latter being an all time favorite of my father. My brother has always loved gorillas over the years and I have painted several for him. Living in Montana also affords me ample opportunity to enjoy and paint elk, deer, bears, turkeys, and other wildlife.
