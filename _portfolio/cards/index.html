<p>My original series of cards was called <strong>"Felted Ladies and their Pets.‚Äù</strong> They were inspired by hand painted post cards I created for my senior citizen friends to brighten their day. Perhaps that is what moved me into experimenting with woolen art and creating whimsical characters. People find the medium of wool warm and very comforting. The caricatures of the Felted Ladies come from my imagination, but many people feel they resemble someone familiar, an aunt or perhaps a close friend. After I sketch an image on felt, I hand stitch the colorful wool strands with a felting needle. My talented printer, Blaise Wrenn, takes the originals and scans them onto greeting cards.</p>

<p>The Felted Ladies and Felted Pets cards are found in various stores, museum gift shops, and art galleries in six western states and they are also sold online. Many customers tell me that the cards bring delight to those that send and receive them. Many people also enjoy collecting the cards and framing them as gifts.</p>

<p>Since the original Felted Ladies, I have expanded to include new women/men, mixed media, and beaded enclusure cards.</p>
