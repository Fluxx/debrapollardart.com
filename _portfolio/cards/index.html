<p>This first series of cards is called <strong>Felted Ladies and their Pets.</strong> They were inspired by my earlier work of hand painted post cards sent to my senior citizen friends to brighten their day. After Iâ€™ve hand stitched the wool strands onto felt, my talented printer, Blaise Wrenn, transfers them to greeting card stock. People find the medium of wool delightful and very comforting.  Perhaps that is what moved me into experimenting with woolen art and creating whimsical characters. The Felted Ladies and Felted Pets cards are found in various stores, museum gift shops, and art galleries in three western states and they are also sold online. Many customers tell me that the cards bring delight to those that send and receive them. Many people also enjoy collecting the cards and framing them as gifts.</p>

<p>The second series is called <strong>The Ladies of Linage</strong>, and is a series of whimsical caricatures of thoughtful, strong, and playful charismatic women digitally finger painted on an iPad. The images appear to be rendered using pen and ink and gouache.</p>
