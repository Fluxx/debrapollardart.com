<p>In my smaller beading pieces, the focus is more on beading and not as on much mixed media. It is still one bead at a time varying the size of beads to create textures and dimension. I find the tactile process to be comforting and yet challenging, as each single bead forms an array of color, sparkle, and whimsy.</p>
