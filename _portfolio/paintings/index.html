<p>Portraits are a main stay of my work and I find the subjects fascinating. In particular, I have always loved African and African American faces. The strength in their features, the soul in their eyes, illuminates the history of their culture. I have painted them in traditional watercolor, and acrylic brushwork style, but more recently moved to using popsicle sticks to create linear powerful marks and textures. The layering of paint and the underbelly of the painting enhances the depth of character and personality of the subject.</p>
